===============

This script speeds up manual conversion of ICD-10 codes. 
The top dozen ICD-10 codes as single function keys, opens each chart easily.

To Use

* Open the Script, the green H called ICD-10-DM (puts a small 'H' icon on your lower right screen tray).
* Go to **Chart Reports**, run the Diabetes report you want to work.
* Press **Windows-Space** or **+ on Number pad** to open up an update.
* Each time you press the hotkey again, it will take you to the next patient's chart. (From 'Update Problems' or 'Update'.)
* Use Function Keys (or manual updating) to change the diabetic codes.
